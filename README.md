# Awesome OPC Python Resource

This repository contains a curated list of resources and tools for working with OPC (Open Platform Communications) in Python. Whether you're developing OPC servers, clients, or exploring OPC-related libraries, this collection aims to provide valuable insights and guidance for your Python OPC projects.

## Background

OPC is a set of communication standards used in industrial automation and process control. It enables interoperability between devices and applications from different vendors, facilitating seamless data exchange and real-time control. OPC UA (Unified Architecture) is the modern and platform-independent version of OPC, designed for enhanced security, scalability, and flexibility.

## Architecture

The OPC architecture consists of many components from sensors to cloud infrastructor covering OT and IOT technologies, the following image showcases some of the basic components that architects an OPC. They are also listed below:

- OPC Server: The OPC server acts as a data provider, exposing process and control data from industrial devices and systems. It serves data through OPC interfaces, making it accessible to OPC clients.
- OPC Client: The OPC client is an application that consumes data from OPC servers. It uses OPC interfaces to browse, read, and write data to the connected OPC servers.

## Getting Started

If you are new to OPC development in Python, you can start by exploring the following resources:
- OPC UA Specification - The official OPC UA specification provided by the OPC Foundation.
- Python OPC UA Documentation - Documentation for the Python OPC UA library, which allows you to develop OPC UA servers and clients.
